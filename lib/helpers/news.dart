    "The urban transport crisis in emerging economies: a comparative overview",
    author: "Pojani, Dorina, Stead, Dominic",
    description: "This chapter reflects on the 12 case studies contained in this book, and identifies some of the key issues, trends, and policy measures which emerge from the previous chapters. Consideration is also given to the lessons that can be learned from these countries and the extent to which they may be generalizable and applicable in other contexts across the world. The chapter is structured according to the main headings used in each of the country-specific chapters.",

    title: "The urban transport crisis in emerging economies: an introduction",
    author:"Pojani, Dorina, Stead, Dominic",
    description: "This chapter discusses urban transport issues, policies, and initiatives in [The Urban Transport Crisis in Emerging Economies: An Introduction/Australia]. Consistent with the other case studies, it covers the following set of issues: Urban land-use patterns and spatial structure; Trends in transport use and mobility; Urban transport problems; Urban transport governance, decision-making, and financing; Proposed urban transport solutions and implementation issues; and Other country-specific issues. The object of this framework is to allow for a comparative analysis across the case studies. This book discusses urban transport issues, policies, and initiatives in 12 of the worlds major emerging economiesBrazil, China, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, and Vietnamcountries with large populations that have recently experienced large changes in urban structure, motorization, and all the associated social, economic, and environmental impacts in positive and negative senses. It documents the worsening transport crisis and differences among these countries in their urban transport and land-use systems. It includes chapters on each of these 12 countries, focusing on one or more major cities per country. In order to present the case studies in a more comparable way, all chapters follow a common format. Each chapter covers the following set of issues: Urban land-use patterns and spatial structure; Trends in transport use and mobility; Urban transport problems; Urban transport governance, decision-making, and financing; Proposed urban transport solutions and implementation issues; and Other country-specific issues. The object of this framework is to help to identify new explanatory factors that may be overlooked in research limited to single cities or nations. By including cities and countries across all continents, the aim is to identify useful lessons on how to achieve urban sustainability goals across the globe.",

    title: "Perspectives on built heritage preservation: a study of Queenslander homeowners in Brisbane, Australia",
    author:"Neilsen, Vanessa and Pojani, Dorina",
    description: "Set in Brisbane–Australia’s third city—this study solicits "
        "the views of residents regarding the preservation of the iconic "
        "Queenslander houses (late nineteenth century–early twentieth century). "
        "Through in-depth interviews with twenty participants, we sought to determine "
        "whether owner-occupiers of Queenslanders value this heritage and why, whether "
        "they are engaged in its protection, and if so, what their motivations are. We "
        "found that Queenslanders are valued on multiple levels: as placemaking features, "
        "as aesthetic pleasure, and as climatic comfort. While maintaining an older home "
        "involves a substantial amount of time and money—available mostly to the middle-class "
        "and middle-aged groups—this is viewed as fair considering the benefits of living "
        "in a Queenslander. Residents believe that the local government can and should do "
        "more to protect what is left of the historical housing stock. However, one portion "
        "of the public only cares to preserve the outer shells of heritage homes while "
        "extensively renovating and modernising interiors. A concern for heritage is sometimes "
        "used as a screen for NIMBYism. As a growing city, Brisbane needs to navigate a fine line "
        "between increasing the supply of apartment units and preserving the character of local "
        "neighbourhoods, which traditionally have been single-family only.",

In this exploratory study, we draw on written and oral qualitative data to set forth popular narratives and sentiments on parking supply and demand. We reveal two competing storylines. The first and more traditional one casts (free) parking as a “birthright” that is to be retained at all cost. The second and more recent storyline – which aligns closely to the position of contemporary planners – casts cars and parking as a “scourge” to be combated in order to restore urban liveability. We conclude that the emergence of this more recent storyline bodes well for the sustainability of urban areas.",
